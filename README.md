# First-Game-Ironhack
This game was created to challenges people to get the biggest score.
The main goal is for the new developper to collect Ironhack icons in order to become a better developper.
Arrows right and left will allow you to move and the space barre to jump. 
The enemy is moving faster and faster and you only have 5 lifes.
